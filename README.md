# rs485-breakout
A tiny development board to quickly prototype RS485/Modbus devices

When building RS485/Modbus networks I have identified a need for a platform that would allow me to put various additional sensors or actuators on the network. Like relays to switch stuff, temperature, humidity sensors or other devices that don't have a native Modbus interface.

This board allows interfacing to different digital busses or analog devices.

## Features

* Robust RS485 interface
* ESD protection
* Extendable Modbus slave firmware
* I2C interface
* SPI interface
* 2 analog inputs
* PWM outputs
* 2x5 0.1' prototyping area
* Small form factor allowing PCB integration or inline integration into cable assembly
